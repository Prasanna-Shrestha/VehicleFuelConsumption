The dataset FuelConsumption.csv is downloaded from kaggle.
The "Vehicle Attributes and Emissions Dataset" contains comprehensive information on various vehicles manufactured in the year 2000.
It includes details such as make, model, vehicle class, engine size, cylinder count, transmission type, and fuel type. Additionally, the dataset provides ranges for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, offering insights into the environmental impact of each vehicle. The dataset encompasses a wide range of vehicle types, from compact to mid-size, and includes both conventional and high-performance models.
With this information, trends in vehicle characteristics, fuel efficiency, and emissions can be studied. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding the automotive landscape and informing discussions on environmental sustainability and transportation policies.
The datatset has 10 columns, description of each column is as:
1) The column Year: indicates the year of manufacture for the vehicles in the dataset.
2) The column Make: represents the brand or manufacturer of the vehicle
3) The column Model: specifies the specific model of the vehicle produced by the manufacturer
4) The column vehicle class: categorizes the vehicles into different classes based on their size and intended use, such as compact, mid-size
5) The column engine size: Denotes the volume of the engine in liters, providing information about the capacity of the vehicle's powerplant.
6) The column cylinders: indicates the number of cylinders present in the vehicle's engine, providing insights into its design and performance characteristics.
7) Transmission: Specifies the type of transmission system used in the vehicle such as automatic (A4, AS5) or manual (M5, M6).
8) Fuel: identifies the type of fuel used by the vehicle, which could be represented by the codes: "X" or "Z", or unspecified "Other" categories.
9) Fuel consumption: presents ranges indicating the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle over a given distance providing insights into its efficiency.
10) Coemissions: provides ranges representing the quantity of CO2 emitted by the vehicle, helping to evaluate its environmental impact.
